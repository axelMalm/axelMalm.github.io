            <p class="infoText">My working experiences have come through after I went to what we call in Sweden gymnasiet. My first real job was at Max burgers flipping burgers and selling in the drive through. I went from there to sales, selling things on the street like subscription plans for WWF.
                That was not what I had planned for either I wanted to do something more creative so I went to Art School. It was cool but didnt lead to more jobs so I went to Norrk√∂ping and studied first Civil Engineering and then Graphical Design neither of thoose were fun so I started looking at Game Development and that fit nicely.
